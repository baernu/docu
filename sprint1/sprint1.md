- Task: Based on video

This task works according to the principle and procedure of TDD. Which means that first as simple as possible 
tests are written that fail. Then an attempt is made to improve these tests so that they no longer fail. 
In addition, further cases are processed and at the end it is checked that the algorithm passes all tests.
